There is a security vulnerability **in MSHTML** that can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.[[1]](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-40444) Detecting Zero-Day vulnerabilities in MSHTML allows a hacker to infect a victim system with a Word file without using Macro!

The new CVE-2021-40444 vulnerability with a score of 8.8 (out of 10) is a remote code execution security breach that exploits a flaw in MSHTML.
